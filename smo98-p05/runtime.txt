File was 'Lorem ipsem dolor' random text repeated over 10MB file,
searched for 'lorem', occurred 7600 times

Results of timing:

With fread():
real 0.124s
user 0.076s
sys  0.048s

With systemcalls:
real 3.3137s
user 0.336s
sys  2.800s

Two major observations can be determined from looking at these results: for one, the use of direct systemcalls causes overall time to completion to increase from 0.124s to 3.3137s, which is a significant slowdown. Next, system calls take up a much greater relative portion of execution time in the version using direct syscalls for reads. 

My major takeaway from this is that it's better to leave systemcalls abstracted away behind their appropriate libraries, as manual usage can not only be hazardous, but it can be inefficient as well.
